# Gas Station + Social Login Beta Test - Quick Feedback

Hey Jill & Bowen! 

## ⚠️ **Status: Compatibility Issue Found** 
Gas station works perfectly with Petra, but has wallet-level incompatibility with Aptos Connect social login.

## 🔍 **What we discovered:**

### ✅ **Petra Wallet**: Perfect gas station integration
- Zero gas fees confirmed
- Proper fee payer transaction handling
- `withFeePayer: true` works as expected

### ❌ **Aptos Connect (Social Login)**: Wallet-level blocking
- Shows "Not enough APT to cover for the transaction gas fee"
- **Even with sufficient APT funding** - not a balance issue!
- Wallet doesn't recognize `withFeePayer: true` transactions

## 🔧 **Workarounds attempted:**
1. **`asFeePayer: true` parameter** - No effect
2. **Different transaction structures** - No effect  
3. **Parameter combinations** - No effect
4. **Funded accounts** - Still blocked (confirms not balance-related)

## 🎯 **Root cause:**
Aptos Connect wallet doesn't properly implement fee payer transaction support. The wallet validates gas fees before our gas station can sponsor them.

## 💡 **Current solution:**
**Dual payment system** - works great!
- **Petra**: Gas station sponsored (zero fees)
- **Social login**: Normal transactions (user pays gas)

## 📋 **Recommendation for Aptos team:**
Aptos Connect needs to properly handle `withFeePayer: true` transactions to enable gas station compatibility for social login users.

**Bottom line:** Gas station is solid, but social login wallets need ecosystem improvements for full compatibility.
