# Gas Station Beta Test - Quick Feedback

Hey Jill! 

## ✅ **Status: Working perfectly!** 
Zero gas fees confirmed in my Highway Billboard test dApp.

## 🔍 **What we tried:**
1. **Server-side approach**: Tried moving gas station to Next.js API routes for security, but hit signing issues (can't sign without private keys server-side)
2. **Client-side approach**: Followed README pattern - works great!

## 🐛 **Two quick integration issues:**

**1. Wallet adapter compatibility:**
```typescript
// README shows: aptos.transaction.sign()
// Web dApps need: signResult.authenticator (extract from wallet adapter)
```

**2. Undocumented gas limit:**
```typescript
// Need: options: { maxGasAmount: 50 }
// Error without it: "max_gas_amount (200000) > maximum value of 50"
```

## 🎯 **Bottom line:**
Gas station is awesome! Just needs those two notes in README for web developers.

**Recommendation:** Client-side integration is the way to go for web dApps.
